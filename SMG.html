		<h2>Vector</h2>
		<img src="images/vector.jpg" width="300" height="150" />
		<p>Vector fires .45ACP rounds with 13 bullets per mag. You can obtain this weapon from Ground Loots. Vector has single shot, double shot, and full auto mode. Vector is a fast, stable and mobile weapon it is really good in close range because of fast firing speed but with only 13 bullets it is pretty hard to secure a kill, an smg extended magazine is a must for Vector.</p>
